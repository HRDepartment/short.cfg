# Installation

Go to your Source game's folder:

- Team Fortress 2: Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg (short-tf)
- CSGO: Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg (short-go & short-gog)

Copy `short.cfg` (applicable to all SE games) and the game-appropriate file(s). Optionally you can also add `short-demo.cfg` if you are going to interact with demos.

Add `exec short.cfg` etc. to your `autoexec.cfg`.

Type `short` / `shorttf` / `shortgo` in-game for commands.
